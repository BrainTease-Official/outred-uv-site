<h1 class="title">FAQ</h1>
  <h2>Your question might be solved here.</h2>
  <h1>Why Won't the Unblocker work?</h1>
  <h3>I host the unblocker on a website that may be blocked for you. If the website I use to host it is blocked, the unblocker will not work for you. Another one of the reasons why it may not working for that your device is incapable of running the unblocker. I am currently working on supplying more links for the unblocker so if it doesn't work, you can access it through a differnet link.</h3>
  <h1>How do I add games?</h1>
  <h3>One of the ways you can add games is by going <a href="https://outred.github.io/main/contribution.html">here</a>, or you can join the <a href="https://discord.gg">Discord support server</a> to request to add games, give feedback, leave reviews for the review page (Unreleased, Patreon subscribers will get early access), report bugs, etc.</h3>
  <h1>How do I make my own?</h1>
  <h3>I suggest have a basic knowledge of front-end language such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Don't forget I am open source so you can take a look at my repo for reference.</h3>
  <h3>So yeah thats it, submit a suggestion <a href="/main/contribution.html">here</a>.</h3>
